The binarized images are passed into the RNN cell one pixel at a time and the final output is taken. Here the output is transformed into fully connected layer of 100 units with a ReLU activation function. It \n",
    "is then passed through another linear layer of width 10 and a softmax operation is used to get the probabilites of each digit. Cross entropy loss function is used for the cost and the Adam optimizer is used to minimize this value.\n",

    "It was noted that the lstm cell was quite unstable and did not perform as well as the GRU cell over the same number of epochs. Many different learning rates turned out to be too small to learn anything in time or to large such that it would quite well for some time till it jumped to much and lost all accuracy."
