## Part 1

For part 1, in order to run the tensorflow models and get the same results as in the table, simply run the Part1_x saved model notebooks. 

If an error occurs, please restart the kernel and run all cells again. 

Thr part1_x notebooks contain the code which saves the models and creates the computatinal graph.

## Part 2

For Part 2, to run the saved models go to the end of the part2_x notebooks and see the section Load Model. Run cells below this section to get the accuracy as in the table as well as the confusion matrix.


```python

```
